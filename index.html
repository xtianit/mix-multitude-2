                        God's provision of Manna was satisfactory to the Jews
                        until the Mix Multitude began to point out to them that
                        everything was wrong with it. This similar action
                        occurred in Eden as the first parents hearkened to
                        strange Satan who found everything that God gave them to
                        be wrong. Their agitation brought a new deal but also
                        calamity, where many dies according to verse 34. Let us
                        consider more on this lesson.

                                he has or receives. This same congregation had
                                God's protection from all the plaques in Egypt.
                                All the silver and gold including the best
                                clothings from all the Egyptian were given to
                                them by God. They received other acts of God
                                including miraculous supply of water which no
                                other nation has ever enjoyed. The manna was one

                                they joined unbelievers to rebel against a

                                servant. If this is your present position then
                                repent quickly before calamnity will befall you.

                        The influence of the mixed multitude is subtle but
                        powerful. As you reflect on this lesson, remember that
                        God calls His people to be separate and to guard their
                        hearts from negative influences. Take practical steps
                        this week to evaluate your associations, test every
                        teaching by the Word, and encourage others to stand firm
                        in faith. Let your life be a positive influence, drawing
                        others closer to Christ.
